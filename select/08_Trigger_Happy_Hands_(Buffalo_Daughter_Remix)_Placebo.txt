The world is run by clowns with trigger happy hands
But the world is run by people that we don't understand
And so we're living in a culture made of death and fear
It doesn't seem the human race will make it through the year

The world is run by lying drunks and balding know it alls
But my mother told me pride would always come before a fall
And I remember in the day when we were young and green
We were filled with hope, we were squeaky clean

The world's an unforgiving place, we've all heard this before
But we want hospitals and equal rights instead of bloody wars
We want the right to blow our minds, as crazy as it seems
The only place you're truly free is cozy in your dreams
I said, the only place you're truly free is cozy in your dreams

Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck

The world is run by clowns with trigger happy hands
But the world is run by people that we don't understand
And so we're living in a culture made of death and fear
It doesn't seem the human race will make it through the year

Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck

Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
Put your hands in the air, wave them like you give a fuck (come on, come on)
